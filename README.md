# tensorflow-ec2

`tensorflow-ec2` allows you
to launch, manage and shut down computing clusters of tensorflow on Amazon EC2. It automatically
sets up tensorflow and its GPU support on the cluster for you. This guide describes 
how to use `tensorflow-ec2` to launch clusters, how to run jobs on them, and how 
to shut them down. It assumes you've already signed up for an EC2 account 
on the [Amazon Web Services site](http://aws.amazon.com/).
